        "3. Histograms: Create a histogram for each variable to visualize its distribution. Histograms are useful for identifying potential outliers or skewed distributions.\n",
        "4. Density Plots: Create a density plot for each variable to visualize its distribution. Density plots are similar to histograms but provide a smoother visualization of the distribution.\n",
        "5. Boxplots: Create a boxplot for each variable to visualize its distribution and identify potential outliers. Boxplots are useful for comparing the distributions of multiple variables.\n",
        "6. Scatterplots: Create scatterplots to visualize the relationships between pairs of variables. Scatterplots can help you identify any patterns or relationships between variables.\n",
        "7. Correlation Matrices: Create a correlation matrix to visualize the relationships between all pairs of variables. Correlation matrices can help you identify any strong relationships or multicollinearity between variables."
